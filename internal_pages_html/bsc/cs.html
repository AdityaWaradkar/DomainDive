    <h2>Introduction : </h2>
    <img class="image1" alt="" src="../../Assets/Home_page/Internal_pages/engineering/hand-drawn-flat-design-rpa-illustration_23-2149277643.jpg">
    <p>A person who earns a bachelor's degree in computer science is typically referred to as a "computer scientist" or simply a "graduate with a degree in computer science." They may also be called a "software engineer" or "programmer" depending on their specific role or focus within the field.Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can execute to perform specific tasks or solve problems. Programmers, also known as developers or software engineers, use programming languages to write these instructions, which are then translated into machine-readable code that the computer can understand and execute.
