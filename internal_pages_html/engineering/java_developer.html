    <h2>Pre-requisite Knowledge : </h2>
    <img class="image2" alt="" src="../../Assets/Home_page/Internal_pages/engineering/pre-requisite.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li>Proficiency in Core Java: At the heart of every full-stack Java developer's skill set is a solid understanding of Core Java. This includes a mastery of fundamental concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. Full-stack developers should be adept at writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. A strong foundation in Core Java provides the necessary building blocks for more advanced development tasks.</li>
        <li>Web Technologies-HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the backbone of web development, allowing developers to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. Understanding how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) with JavaScript is crucial for creating seamless user experiences.</li>
        <li>Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Spring Framework: Java EE provides a set of specifications and APIs for building enterprise-level applications. A Java developer should have a solid understanding of Java EE, covering topics such as servlets, JSP (Java Server Pages), and EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans). Additionally, proficiency in the Spring Framework, which simplifies Java development and promotes best practices, is highly beneficial. Spring offers features such as dependency injection, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.</li>
        <li>Database Management-SQL and JDBC: A Java developer must be adept at working with databases to store and retrieve data efficiently. SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for database management, and developers should be comfortable writing complex queries. Knowledge of JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is crucial for establishing connections between Java applications and databases, enabling seamless data interaction.</li>
        <li>Front-End Frameworks- Angular or React: To enhance the user interface and build robust front-end applications, full stack Java developers often use popular front-end frameworks such as Angular or React. These frameworks facilitate the development of single-page applications (SPAs) and ensure a more organized and scalable codebase. Knowledge of component-based architecture and state management is essential when working with these frameworks.</li>
        <li>Build Tools- Maven or Gradle: Efficient project management and dependency resolution are critical aspects of full stack Java development. Build tools like Maven or Gradle automate the build process, manage dependencies, and streamline the overall project structure. Familiarity with these tools is essential for maintaining a well-organized and easily maintainable codebase.</li>
        <li>Version Control-Git: Collaborative development is a common practice in the software industry, and version control systems like Git are indispensable for managing code changes, tracking revisions, and facilitating collaboration among developers. Full stack Java developers should be proficient in using Git for version control and should understand concepts like branches, merges, and pull requests.</li>
        <li>Knowledge of DevOps Practices: Full stack Java developers are increasingly expected to be involved in the entire software development lifecycle, including deployment and operations. Embracing DevOps practices involves collaboration between development and operations teams, automating processes, and ensuring a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. Familiarity with tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI for automated builds and deployments is crucial.</li>
        <li>Cloud Computing Platforms-AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud: As organizations increasingly migrate to the cloud, Java developers should have a basic understanding of cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This includes knowledge of deploying and scaling applications in the cloud, configuring cloud services, and optimizing performance.</li>
        <li>Security Awareness: With the rising number of cyber threats, security is a top priority in software development. Full-stack Java developers should be well-versed in secure coding practices, understanding common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms is essential to protect applications and user data.</li>
